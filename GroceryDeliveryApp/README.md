# GroceryDeliveryApp

A SwiftUI-based iOS app skeleton for a grocery delivery service using MVVM architecture.

This project provides placeholder logic for connecting to a backend API and demonstrates how you might structure a modern SwiftUI application.

## Features

- User authentication (login/signup)
- Browse categories and products
- Cart with quantity adjustments
- Delivery address input and scheduling
- Secure checkout flow (placeholders for Stripe/Apple Pay)
- Order history and reordering

All network operations are stubbed out in `APIService` for integration with your backend.

## Running

Open the project in Xcode and run on iOS 15 or later.
